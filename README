Dataset description === This is a dataset to accompany the 2023 journal submission "Characterizing medial temporal lobe vulnerability to neurofibrillary tangle pathology in Alzheimerâ€™s disease using a 3-D ex vivo MRI atlas and serial histology" by Ravikumar et al. This is a following up to the study presented in 
Ravikumar, Sadhana, et al. Acta neuropathologica communications 9.1 (2021). 

The dataset contains ex vivo MRI scans, reconstructed Nissl histology sections, reconstructed anti-tau immmunohistochemistry sections, and derived tau neurofibrillary tangle burden maps for 18 brain donors.
