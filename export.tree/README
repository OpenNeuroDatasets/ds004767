Dataset description === This is a dataset to accompany the 2023 journal submission "Characterizing medial temporal lobe vulnerability to neurofibrillary tangle pathology in Alzheimerâ€™s disease using a 3-D ex vivo MRI atlas and serial histology" by Ravikumar et al. This is a following up to the study presented in 
Ravikumar, Sadhana, et al. Acta neuropathologica communications 9.1 (2021). 

The dataset contains ex vivo MRI scans and medial temporal lobe (MTL) segmentations of 55 human temporal lobe specimens, a computational atlas constructed using a custom groupwise registration pipeline applied to all 55 specimens, a consensus labelling of the MTL subregions and subfields in the atlas based on cytoarchitectural boundaries defined in 17 specimens, and derived tau neurofibrillary tangle burden maps for 25 brain donors.
